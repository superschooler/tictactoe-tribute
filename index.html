        <p id="tribute-info">
          Tic-tac-toe is traditionally a paper-and-pencil game for two players
          to take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid with an "X"
          or "O." The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a
          horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, many variations of tic-tac-toe exist and it can be played on
          paper or a computer and against a real or virtual opponent. Even smart
          TVs have the game available for download and free play.

            Misère Tic-Tac-Toe: Exactly the same as regular tic-tac-toe, but you
            win by forcing <em>your opponent</em> into getting three-in-a-row.
            You win by losing!

            Six-in-a-row doesn't count!

            First to make a three-in-a-row using either shape wins.

            person (Order) wants to get five-in-a-row of either shape. The other
            player (Chaos) tries to prevent any five-in-a-rows (so, Chaos wants
            a cat’s game).

            You can play on any of the boards on your turn. The first person to
