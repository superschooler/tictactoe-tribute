# Tribute to Tic-Tac-Toe

## [freeCodeCamp Tribute Page Project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/build-a-tribute-page-project/build-a-tribute-page)

I first went through freeCodeCamp's HTML & CSS content about three years ago and made my tribute to **Dora the Explorer**, a running joke I've had since a college speech class where I snuck her in every presentation and speech I could.

This time, I wanted to change it up a bit and make my tribute to an object, rather than a person (assuming you can call Dora the Explorer a person).

To come up with tic-tac-toe, I simply went to [Google](google.com) and clicked the _I'm Feeling Lucky_ button. The first result I got was tic-tac-toe, so I ran with it.

To come up with the layout for the web page, I browsed [Envato Elements' Personal HTML Templates](https://elements.envato.com/web-templates/personal/properties-responsive) and used one I liked as inspiration. While my project looks nothing like the template I was using as an example, I think it turned out a hundred times better than if I were to design it myself. I've never been great at UI, which is why I find CSS to be challenging.

I hope you enjoy the project and I'm looking forward to continuing the journey!
